## Overview

Montage Data is a framework that allows
[Montage](https://github.com/montagejs/montage) applications to easily exchange
data with servers. It maps server data to model objects accessible in
application code, allowing complex server operations to be performed by reading
and writing the properties of model objects obtained with simple queries.

Montage Data is an Object Service Mapping (OSM), a superset of an Object
Relational Mapping (ORM) that also works for servers offering REST or other
types of non-relational services.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by executing `jsdoc -c .jsdoc.conf.json` in the
root of the project and read by opening the resulting `out/doc/index.html` in a
web browser.

## Testing

Tests can be run by executing `npm install` in the `test` subdirectory and then
loading `test/run.html` through a web server. Tests can be created by editing
`test/run.js`.
